Ginpar
======

Ginpar is a static content generator for interactive P5.js sketches,
awkwardly named after **Generative Interactive Parametrisable Canvases**.

By separating the primary development and the parametric experimentation,
it allows you to stop thinking about code once your pieces have reached
an acceptable level of complexity, freeing you to experiment in a GUI for
the browser.

Features:

- Simple API to define the controllable variables in your sketch.
- Easy to adapt existing sketches.
- Easy replicability of each final result.
- Index page to list all your sketches.
