Params API
==========

This is the API documentation for the ``params`` field inside a single sketch
data file ``data.yaml``. Check :ref:`data:Sketch data`

Data files contain instructions to build the pages for individual sketches,
such as the sketch parameters, source code obfuscation, sketch hashing, etc.

All these values are converted into a Python dictionary and then associated
with the sketch. Ginpar will use this dictionary to render
``sketch templates``.

date
----

*Date, Required* [Date.today()]

Ginpar will automatically generate a ``name`` when processing the parameter
info. This value is generated by removing *snake_case* from the string and
capitalizing::

    MY_VERY_VERBOSE_VARIABLE ==> My very verbose variable

However, if you'd like to use a different name instead of the generated one,
you can specify it in its values.


name
----

*Boolean, Optional* [**Not defined by default**]

Ginpar will automatically generate a ``name`` when processing the parameter
info. This value is generated by removing *snake_case* from the string and
capitalizing::

    MY_VERY_VERBOSE_VARIABLE ==> My very verbose variable

However, if you'd like to use a different name instead of the generated one,
you can specify it in its values.

attrs
-----

*List, Required*

All the *key-value* pairs inside the ``attrs`` field will be added to the
input tag as attributes.

In ``attrs`` you can (and should) specify all the
`input tag attributes`_ you'd like to include in your input.

The only required field is ``value``, however, Ginpar will produce a better
output if you specify ``type``, ``value``, ``step``, ``min``, ``max``.
